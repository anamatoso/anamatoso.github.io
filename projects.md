        <h3 class="title">Feb 2022 - Oct 2022: Master Thesis</h3>
        <p>My master thesis, titled "Investigating Structural Connectivity in Episodic Migraine using Graph Theory", searches for biomarkers of episodic migraine using DWI data. Then tractography methods are applied and a connectome is made, from which connectivity metrics are analysed.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Sep 2021 - Dec 2021: Boat Management System</h3>
        <p>This project was built in the scope of the course "Information Systems and Databases" and it consisted in the development of a database model (E-A model), of writing SQL queries and OLAP queries, integrity constraints, and the creation of a web application prototype.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Sep 2021 - Dec 2021: Machine Learning Project</h3>
        <p>This project entailed the resolution of several machine learning problems not only of regression but also of classification. The following algorithms were used: Linear/Lasso/Ridge Regression, Linear Support Vector Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian Processes, Convolutional Neural Networks, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbours. Additionally, k-fold cross validation, outlier detection and ensemble learning were also used. </p>

        <h3 class="title">Feb 2021 - Jun 2012: Sleep Stage Classification</h3>
        <p>This project was made in the scope of the course "Signal Processing in Bioengineering" and aimed at the classification of sleep stages from multi-modal Polysomnogram (PSG) recordings. Preprocessing techniques were evaluated, namely ICA vs conventional filtering, and a support vector machines algorithm was used for the classification.
        The final minipaper can be found on the LaSEEB's <a href="https://wiki.laseeb.org/attachments/download/137/G6%20Sleep%20Stage%20Classification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Feb 2020 - Jun 2020: Heart Rate and Pulse Transit Time Sensor using PPG and ECG</h3>
        <p>This project's main goal was to develop a sensor that could calculate the heart rate and pulse transit time in real time. To that end, an Arduino Uno was used as well as ECG and PPG sensors. Real time processing (using Arduino) and post processing (using MATLAB) approaches were compared.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Feb 2020 - Jun 2020: Cancer Detection Algorithm</h3>
        <p>This project's main goal was to develop a classifier based on Bayes Networks that could predict if a person has cancer given certain biomedical data. This project was done in Java, where two applications were created: one to read the data and to learn from it and another to, given a set of data, predict, with a certain probability, if that person had cancer.</p>
