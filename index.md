Hello! My name is Ana and I’m a biomedical engineering student currently studying at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), University of Lisbon. I am interested in areas where computing meets biology thus having developed my master's thesis in computational neuroscience.
</p>

<p>I love to learn and face new challenges since I am a very curious person. As an engineering graduate, I’ve acquired several skills throughout my progress, such as being proactive, organized, determined, and motivated to do a project even when faced with a conundrum. Besides, I consider myself a creative person that loves to brainstorm and discuss new ideas.</p>

<p>That being said, I aspire to make a difference in people’s lives by using technology and applying it to the healthcare field.</p>
