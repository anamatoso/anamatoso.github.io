#### What are private and public keys?

<br />
<br />

#### On the Local Machine

ssh-keygen (passphrase empty and put path to file, that should go to users/ana/.ssh/keys)

<br />
in the file ~/.ssh/config, paste 
    Host host
        HostName host
        User user
        IdentityFile /path/to/private/key

<br />
copy the public key (open key.pub and copy)
<br />


#### On the Remote Machine
in the remote machine, in directory ~/.ssh create file names authorized keys and paste there the public key
now when you, in a new terminal window try to access the remote machine through ssh, you wonâ€™t need a password
