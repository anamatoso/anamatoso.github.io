# Introduction

As a student of biomedical engineering at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, I have always found that there is far too little time that is spent in a clinical setting. As such, when I got the opportunity to undertake an observational internship at the gastroenterology techniques unit at Hospital de Santa Maria, I was excited to take on this endeavour. This experience turned out to be one of the most formative of my career since it allowed me to experience first hand how engineering could help medical practice.

# Observing Procedures at the Unit

From the very first day of my internship, I was given the opportunity to observe a wide range of procedures, from endoscopies and colonoscopies to biopsies and other diagnostic tests. I was astonished by the amount of procedures that were done in a day. Nevertheless, the medical professionals were very welcoming are were always pleased to explain what was happening.

# Learning Outcomes

Throughout the internship, I learned how communication is key between medical professionals so that everyone is on the same page whilst performing the procedures. Furthermore, I also learned new ways of how technology can be applied in the medical field that would be of benefit in the gastroenterology field.

I also learned a great deal about the equipment used and the steps involved in each procedure. The technical details of the medical equipment were fascinating to me, and I found myself wanting to learn more about the engineering behind the equipment and tools used.

<br />

# Conclusion

Overall, my experience at the gastroenterology techniques unit at Hospital de Santa Maria was an incredibly valuable one. I learned so much about the equipment and techniques used to identify and treat gastrointestinal diseases, as well as the importance of technical skills and interdisciplinary collaboration. I am grateful for the opportunity to have observed such skilled professionals at work and I am sure that this experience will stay with me throughout my career as a biomedical engineer.
